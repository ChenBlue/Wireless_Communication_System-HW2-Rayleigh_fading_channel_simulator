# Wireless_Communication_System-HW2-Rayleigh_fading_channel_simulator
This is the homework from COM5170 Wireless Communication in National Tsing Hua University. There are two parts of this HW: </br>
1. Implement a Rayleigh fading channel simulator based on the Filtered Gaussian Noise method
   * Plot the channel output for fmT = 0.01, 0.1 and 0.5 (t/T = 0 ~ 300)
   * Plot the channel output autocorrelation for fmT = 0.01, 0.1 and 0.5 (fm $\tau$ = 0 ~ 10)
2. Implement a Rayleigh fading channel simulator based on the Sum of Sinusoids method
   * Plot the channel output for M = 8 and 16 (fmT = 0.01, 0.1, 0.5 and t/T = 0 ~ 300)
   * Plot the channel output autocorrelation for M = 8 and 16 (fm $\tau$ = 0 ~10)
